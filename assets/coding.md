# Resources-for-Beginner-Bug-Bounty-Hunters

## Coding & Scripting 🤖

### Info
Many Beginners often ask if Coding is a necessity for Bug Bounty.<br>
Short Answer: No.<br>
But as often discussed on @nahamsec Twitch Channel, it is a good tool to have in General. Coding can help you a lot with understanding stuff that you will encounter on your Hacking Sessions, but it is also generally a good skill to have in the current times. You can automate your Tools with Python for example, or write completely new ones if you have a specific task for it in mind. We will add a lot more in here over the next updates and also reorganize the Resources by Languages and so on.

TL,DR: ___Python___ and ___Bash___ are really good skills to have and start out with.
